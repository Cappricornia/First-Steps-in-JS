## First Steps in JS: 🏁

- Introduction to JavaScript
- Variables, data types, and basic operators
- Understanding and using console.log for debugging

- Simple input and output operations

## Conditional Statements: ❓
- Introduction to decision-making in programming
- Using if, else if, and else statements
- Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) for complex conditions
- Case studies and practical examples

## Nested If Statements: 🪹
- Handling multiple levels of conditions
- Proper indentation and code readability

## For Loop: 🪢
- Introduction to loops and their importance
- Syntax and structure of the for loop
- Iterating over arrays and performing actions
- Controlling loop execution with break and continue

## While Loop: 🪢
- Understanding the while loop and its use cases
- Setting up loop conditions and managing iteration

## Nested Loops: 🪹🪢🪢
- Handling intricate problems with nested loops
- Combining for and while loops effectively
- Examples of nested loop patterns

## Data Types and Variables: 🗃️

- Data Types: JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning variables can hold values of different types such as numbers, strings, booleans, objects, arrays, etc.
- Variables: Variables are used to store data values. Use let to declare a variable with block scope, var for function scope (not recommended), and const for constants.
- Primitive Data Types: Includes numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined, symbols, and BigInt.
- Numbers: Represented as floating-point numbers, supporting both integers and decimals.
- Strings: Sequences of characters, enclosed in single (''), double (""), or backticks (``) for template literals.
-  Booleans: Represent true or false values.
-  ull and Undefined: Represent the absence of value. null is explicitly assigned, while undefined is the default value for uninitialized variables.
- A rrays: Ordered collections of values, accessed by indices starting from 0.
- Functions: Blocks of reusable code. Can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.
